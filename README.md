All data used for this paper could be found in datasets/...

If you are interested about data construction, you can acquire raw datasets and run data_processing.py:

A. The datasets we used:
- Lmwp: Linear equation MWPs proposed by [MaKE](https://github.com/tal-ai/MaKE_EMNLP2021)
- Hmwp: hybrid equation MWPs proposed by [SAU-Solver](https://github.com/QinJinghui/SAU-Solver)

B. see preprocess/... 


## Train
